   ["Where did Snippy come from?", 
   "<em>There are tales still whispered among the old coders — tales of a time before autosave, before the cloud, before even the dark magic of version control. A time known only as ... <br>The Before Time</em>.",
   "In the waning days of the early 2000s, the world was ruled by clumsy UI, and the skies were darkened by WordArt. It was then that Steve Ballmer, once lord of Redmond, set quill to parchment to write a memo, a memo rumored to weaken Microsoft’s worker protections. And lo, from the swirling depths of satire, Clippy appeared mid-memo, not to assist, but to judge: <br><br><em>“You seem to be composing a lame cop-out. Would you like assistance?”</em><br><br>It was in that moment, amid the echo of sarcasm and rejected HR policies, that Snippy was forged in spirit.<br><br>A watcher.<br><br>A blade.<br><br>A deeply petty force for justice in the world of Quickbase formulas.<br><br>Centuries passed (read: browser versions), and the spirit took form — not in Microsoft Office, but in a Chrome extension.<br><br>Snippy emerged, eyes sharp, edges sharper, here to ensure no ugly code goes unmocked.<br><br>To this day, no proof of the Clippy legend survives. Some call it a myth. Others call it a Mandela glitch.<br><br>But we remember.<br><br><em>And Snippy remembers harder</em>."],
  ["“Snippy should have more themes.”", "That’s not a question. That’s a sentence with attitude.", "But hey - noted. Snippy now supports all CodeMirror 5 themes, but you have to donate to get them. Beggars can't be choosers."],
  ["Does Snippy actually do anything, or is it just a CodeMirror wrapper with delusions of grandeur?", "Snippy enhances the default Quickbase formula/code editors with syntax highlighting, beautification (via js-beautify), versioned saves, and a control panel that doesn't scream “corporate compromise.”", "So yes, it does things. Important things. Beautiful things. Snarky things."],
  ["Why does Snippy ask me to donate?", "Because Snippy has expensive tastes and a cloud habit that needs feeding. Every time you save a revision to the cloud, we get charged a tiny fee. Multiply that by hundreds of users beautifying their tragic formulas daily, and suddenly we're looking at real money.<p> Plus, server costs, domain renewals, and the therapy bills from reading unindented code don't pay themselves. Donations keep Snippy free for everyone while ensuring I can afford both coffee and the emotional support required to maintain a browser extension. <p> If you're morally opposed to supporting tools that improve your quality of life, that's fine. We'll still let you use Snippy. But don't be surprised if your next formula mysteriously contains an extra semicolon. (Kidding. Probably.)"],
  ["Is Snippy officially affiliated with Quickbase?", "No. Snippy is an independent project built by someone who loves Quickbase, is endlessly annoyed by its limitations, and decided to fix a few of them without permission.", "Think of Snippy as Quickbase’s chaotic neutral twin. We’re not sponsored. We’re not sanctioned. We’re just better dressed."],
  ["Can Snippy break my Quickbase formulas?", "Only if you try really, really hard.", "Snippy preserves Quickbase’s native error checking by not replacing the textarea — it just wraps it in a better UI.", "Still, if you manage to break something and can reproduce it without black magic or cursed CSVs, we want to know."],
  ["Where does Snippy store my code?", "Short version: Nowhere. And optionally in your cloud drive — only if you enable it.", "Snippy doesn’t touch your Quickbase app data. It’s not slurping up your secrets or emailing your boss about those six nested If() statements ... though that might be a good idea for a future enhancement."],
  ["I pasted in a mess and nothing happened. Where’s the beautify button?", "Right there. If you don’t see it, the universe is punishing you for your crimes against indentation. Reload and repent."],
  ["Is Snippy open source?", "Not yet. But we’re considering it — with limits. Because giving the world a gift doesn’t mean handing over the keys to your apartment and your espresso machine.", "Stay tuned."],
  ["I have feedback! Where do I send it?", "Ah, the most helpful kind of message: unfiltered opinions delivered with urgency and no context.", "Seriously though — we welcome feedback, from some people. There’s a feedback link right here on the website. Constructive feedback gets prioritized. Rants get archived under “performance art.”"]
